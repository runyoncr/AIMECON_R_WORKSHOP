# Activity: Prompt Engineering {#sec-act-prompting}

It's time to practice prompt engineering!


###################
Most important for non-conversational interactions with models.

In conversational interactions you can provide feedback.

## Task X : Prompt Improvement

- Step 1: Write your own prompt - whatever topic you'd like, or re-use one that we've already used today. Don't submit the prompt to the model yet.

- Step 2: Using the prompt below to ask the model for help with your prompt.

I'd like your help improving the prompt below. Please review it and suggest ways to make it clearer and more effective.
Specifically:
•	Identify any missing context or details that would help generate better results
•	Point out areas where the prompt might be vague or ambiguous
•	Suggest how to better structure the request
•	Recommend any information I should add about my goals, audience, or desired format
Here is my prompt: {paste your prompt here}

```{r, eval = FALSE}

chat <- chat_anthropic()

chat$chat("I'd like your help improving the prompt below. Please review it and suggest ways to make it clearer and more effective.

Here is my prompt:

What are the pros and cons of Bayesian vs Frequentist statistics? For each point, include a brief explanation.")

## Bayesian v Frequentist Statistics Prompt Revision

Your prompt is a good start, but here are several ways to make it clearer and more effective:

## Current Issues:

**Vague/Ambiguous Areas:**
- "Brief explanation" is subjective - what length do you consider brief?
- No specification of technical depth or mathematical complexity
- Unclear what aspects of the comparison matter most to you
- No guidance on format or structure preferences

**Missing Context:**
- Your background/expertise level in statistics
- Intended audience for this information
- Specific use case or application context
- Whether you want practical examples or theoretical focus

## Improved Prompt Structure:

"I need a comparison of Bayesian vs Frequentist statistical approaches for [**YOUR CONTEXT** - e.g., "a graduate-level 
biostatistics course" or "business decision-making presentation"].

**Background:** [YOUR EXPERIENCE LEVEL - e.g., "I have basic statistical knowledge but am new to these philosophical 
differences"]

**Format requested:**
- 4-6 key pros and cons for each approach
- Each point explained in 2-3 sentences
- [Include/exclude mathematical notation]
- Include 1-2 practical examples where each approach excels

**Focus areas I'm most interested in:**
- [e.g., Practical implementation, philosophical differences, computational requirements, interpretation of results]

**Audience:** [e.g., "Non-statisticians who need to understand methodology choices" or "Statistics students preparing 
for exams"]"

## Recommended Additions:

1. **Specify your goal** - Are you choosing between methods, teaching others, or writing a paper?
2. **Define scope** - Do you want to cover computational aspects, philosophical foundations, or practical 
applications?
3. **Set constraints** - Word count, technical level, specific statistical contexts (hypothesis testing, parameter 
estimation, etc.)

Would you like to revise your prompt with some of these suggestions?

:::

What improvements did the model suggest? 
Did it identify anything you hadn’t considered? 
Was the feedback helpful or too generic? 
How would you revise your prompt based on the suggestions? 
If you used the prompt before, did you get a better result using the revised prompt suggested by AI?
