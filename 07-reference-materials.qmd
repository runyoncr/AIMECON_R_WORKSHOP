## Background Information on GPTs

The [3Blue1Brown YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown){target="_blank"} provides several good videos on the some of the technical aspects of large language models.

* The [Neural Networks](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi){target="_blank"} section is particularly informative.

Anthropic's paper [On the Biology of a Large Language Model](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2025/attribution-graphs/biology.html){target="_blank"} is particularly interesting.

This [post on lesswrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/XGHf7EY3CK4KorBpw/understanding-llms-insights-from-mechanistic){target="_blank"} provides a nice high-level summary for understanding LLMs.

### Newsletters

### Books

[AI Engineering](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-engineering/9781098166298/){target="_blank"} by Chip Huyen is a slightly more advanced read for those interested in building AI products.

[Prompt Engineering for Generative AI: Future-Proof Inputs for Reliable AI Outputs](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/prompt-engineering-for/9781098153427/){target="_blank"} by James Phoenix and Mike Taylor is also a good resource for learning more about prompt engineering.

[Brave New Words](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/740806/brave-new-words-by-salman-khan/) by Sal Khan (of [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) fame) is an interesting perspective on how AI will change education.
