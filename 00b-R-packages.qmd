# R Packages {#sec-r-packages}

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
#| echo: false
# source("_formatting.R")
```

R's strength lies not just in its statistical capabilities, but in its open-source nature. 
Râ€™s code is freely available for anyone to inspect, modify, and improve. 
This openness has cultivated a vibrant global community of statisticians, data scientists, and developers who actively contribute to the language's evolution.

The R package ecosystem exemplifies this collaborative spirit. 
Community members can develop packages that address specific needs that span many academic domains (see [Task Views](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/){target="_blank"}). 
These packages allow you to utilize and build on classic and new analytical methods, advancing science and, thereby, public good.


```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

install.packages(c("tidyverse", "curl", "ragnar", "duckdb", "shiny", "shinyjs"))

```
