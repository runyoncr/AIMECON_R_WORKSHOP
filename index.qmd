This online resource was created to be a user-friendly way to share the materials in support of the "Integrating Generative AI into R Workflows: From APIs to Shiny Apps" workshop, first given at [AIMECON in October, 2025](https://www.xcdsystem.com/ncme/program/4HfWHuL/index.cfm).

Although created primarily for this purpose, I intend to periodically update these materials as I learn and as the models continue to evolve.
