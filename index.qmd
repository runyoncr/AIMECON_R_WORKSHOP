This online book was created to be a user-friendly way to present the materials in support of the "Integrating Generative AI into R Workflows: From APIs to Shiny Apps" workshop, first given at [AIMECON in October, 2025](https://www.xcdsystem.com/ncme/program/4HfWHuL/index.cfm){target="_blank"}.
Although created primarily for this purpose, I intend to continually update these materials as I learn and as the models continue to evolve.
(Although I learn slower than these models evolve, so some information might be out of date.)


<!-- This endeavor reminds me of the quote "The only constant is change", usually attributed to [Heraclitus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraclitus){target="_blank"} ([maybe wrongly](https://euppublishingblog.com/2021/07/19/misunderstanding-of-heraclitus/){target="_blank"}). -->

Learning Objectives
</div>

[By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to:]{.underline}

-	Explain key LLM architectural features that inform effective integration practices
-	Apply prompt engineering principles to achieve consistent, reliable outputs in R workflows
-	Implement both single-use and conversational API interactions with LLMs from R
-	Design and deploy simple multi-agentic systems for complex tasks
-	Build interactive Shiny applications that leverage LLM capabilities for end-user functionality

This book is a living document. Here's what I plan on covering next:

| **Criteria** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Content      | Paragraph is well-developed and relevant to the argument, supported with strong reasons and examples.                                                                                                                                                   |
| Organization | The argument is very effectively structured and developed, making it easy for the reader to follow the ideas and understand how the writer is building the argument. Paragraphs use coherence devices effectively while focusing on a single main idea. |
| Language     | The writing displays sophisticated control of a wide range of vocabulary and collocations. The essay follows grammar and usage rules throughout the paper. Spelling and punctuation are correct throughout the paper.                                   |
