This online book was created to be a user-friendly way to present the materials in support of the "Integrating Generative AI into R Workflows: From APIs to Shiny Apps" workshop, first given at [AIMECON in October, 2025](https://www.xcdsystem.com/ncme/program/4HfWHuL/index.cfm){target="_blank"}.
Although created primarily for this purpose, I intend to contiually update these materials as I learn.
