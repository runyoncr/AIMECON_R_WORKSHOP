This online resource shares materials from the "Integrating Generative AI into R Workflows: From APIs to Shiny Apps" workshop, first given at [AIMECON in October, 2025](https://www.xcdsystem.com/ncme/program/4HfWHuL/index.cfm). I'll periodically continue to update these materials as I learn and the models evolve.

The workshop assumes some working knowledge of the R programming language, and assumes little generative AI knowledge. If you need more information on using R, I highly recommend Hadley Wickham's (free) [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/).

Learning Objectives
</div>

[By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to:]{.underline}

-	Explain key LLM architectural features that inform effective integration practices
-	Apply prompt engineering principles to achieve useful outputs in R workflows
-	Implement both conversational and transcational API interactions with LLMs from R
-	Design and deploy simple chained prompt workflows for complex tasks
-	Build interactive Shiny applications that leverage LLM capabilities for end-user functionality
