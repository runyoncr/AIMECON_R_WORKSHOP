# API Keys {#sec-api-keys}
  
## What are these?

An API key is a unique identifier that allows software programs to communicate securely with external services, such as a large language model hosted by a provider. 
The key acts like a digital credential: it tells the system who you are, verifies that you have permission to use the service, and tracks how much you use it for billing and security purposes. 
In practice, it’s a long string of letters and numbers that you include in your code whenever you send a request to the model.

I asked OpenAI's ChatGPT5 to generate a fake API key for demonstrative purposes.
They generall look like this: `sk-3vT9aP1LQ2Rz4w7Xe8Kj9Nh2yTfBc5Ud6VgW1xZq`.
The actual prefixes and length of random alphanumeric characters will usually vary by provider.

For users integrating LLMs into R or other analytic workflows, the API key serves as the bridge between your local environment and the remote model. 
When your script makes an API call, the key authenticates that request and returns the model’s response. 
Because API keys grant direct access to paid and potentially sensitive resources, they should be stored securely—never shared publicly, committed to version control, or embedded directly in reproducible code examples.

In essence, the API key is what allows researchers to treat a model as a callable function, enabling controlled, programmatic access to a complex system running on remote infrastructure. 
Understanding how to manage this key responsibly is a foundational step in incorporating LLMs into reproducible research and educational applications.

## Workshop API Key {#sec-workshop-key}

I created an API key that you will be able to use for the purposes of the workshop.
This API key will only be active during the workshop hours.
If you attempt to use the API key outside of these hours, you will see that it has been disabled and your calls to the model will not be completed.

Because API keys are cost-per-use, I ask that you please only do the workshop activities and other experimentation. 
Use costs are relatively low for this type of use and I'm happy to cover the cost and provide an API key for educational purposes.
