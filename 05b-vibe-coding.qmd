_Vibe Coding_ is the recent term of the art for using an LLM to help you write syntax, which includes online applications. The term was coined by Andrej Karpathy in a tweet on February 2, 2025 [(ars technica article)](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/is-vibe-coding-with-ai-gnarly-or-reckless-maybe-some-of-both/){target="_blank"}

Reduces tedious syntax writing

## `shinychat`

Unsurprisingly, Posit has created an interface to help you add an AI chatbot to a Shiny app.

I haven't extensively worked with this, but wanted to suggest it for those ambitious workshop participants that might want to integrate an AI chatbot in their Shiny app.
