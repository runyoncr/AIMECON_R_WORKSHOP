# Acknowledgements

Many thanks to those that helped me in creating this guide (whether they knew it or not ðŸ˜…).

- [Victoria Yaneva](){target="_blank"}, who really helped me upskill in all things related to NLP and AI.

- [Hadley Wickham](https://hadley.nz/){target="_blank"}. Aside from being generally inspirational in the quality of their work and open-science attitude, I largely modeled this Quarto book off his immensely helpful ["R for Data Science"](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/){target="_blank"} book. Being able to review the code used to make this book saved me a significant amount of time in learning Quarto.
