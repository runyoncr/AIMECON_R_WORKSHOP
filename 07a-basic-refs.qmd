The [3Blue1Brown YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown) provides several good videos on the some of the technical aspects of large language models.
* The [Neural Networks](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi) section is particularly informative.

Anthropic's paper [On the Biology of a Large Language Model](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2025/attribution-graphs/biology.html) is particularly interesting.

This [post on lesswrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/XGHf7EY3CK4KorBpw/understanding-llms-insights-from-mechanistic) provides a nice high-level summary for understanding LLMs.
