# Acknowledgements {#sec-acknowledgements .unnumbered}

Many thanks to those that helped me in creating this guide (whether they knew it or not ðŸ˜…).

- [Victoria Yaneva](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WAA5-vwAAAAJ&hl=en){target="_blank"}, who really helped me upskill in all things related to NLP and AI.

- [Hadley Wickham](https://hadley.nz/){target="_blank"}. Aside from being generally inspirational in the quality of their work and open-science attitude, I largely modeled this Quarto book off his immensely helpful ["R for Data Science"](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/){target="_blank"} book. Being able to review the [code](https://github.com/hadley/r4ds/){target="_blank"} used to make that book saved me a significant amount of time in learning Quarto and making this book.
